## Description

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook, **Stock Market Portfolio Optimization**, that demonstrates how to build and analyze an optimized equity portfolio using Python. Leveraging historical market data, Modern Portfolio Theory, and numerical optimization techniques, the notebook walks you through:

- Fetching and preparing historical stock price data with `yfinance`  
- Calculating key portfolio metrics: expected returns, volatility, and Sharpe Ratio  
- Simulating thousands of random portfolios to visualize the risk–return trade‑off  
- Plotting the Efficient Frontier and identifying the optimal portfolio  
- (Optional) Solving for the mathematically optimal weights using `cvxpy`

Whether you’re a finance student, data scientist, or simply curious about quantitative investing, this notebook offers a hands‑on guide to understanding and implementing portfolio optimization in Python.
